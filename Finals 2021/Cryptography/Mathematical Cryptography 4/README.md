# Mathematical Cryptography 4

The challenge tells us that this is a German ADFGVX cipher. Since we need to crack this, I search up "ADFGVX cipher decode", trying to find a website that can decode this cipher. It looks like [dcode.fr](https://www.dcode.fr/adfgvx-cipher) has a ADFGVX cipher tool (sidenote: dcode.fr is a great site). Put in the cipher text and insert the appropriate letters into the matrix. Note that ADFGVX already goes down the top and the side. Enter the matrix and enter the keyword `RADFORD`. A screenshot of my settings are below.

Once you do that, a string will be outputted on the left. Copy the flag into a text editor (or notepad) and add spaces.

The flag is `AFTER WORLD WAR I ENDED IN 1918 THE GERMANS SAW THAT MANY OF THEIR CIPHERS WERE BROKEN LEADING THEM TO ADOPT ENIGMA IN WORLD WAR II`.
