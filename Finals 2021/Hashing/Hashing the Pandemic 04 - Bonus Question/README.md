# Hashing the Pandemic 04 - Bonus Question

[Challenge](challenge.png)

This challenge was unlocked once the "Hashing the Pandemic 04" challenge was completed.

Looking at the challenge, I thought to input the names into Google. I typed in "Astoria Quincy Vincennes Canberra".

Looking at the results, it looks like the names above are the names of World War II ships. They all participated in the Battle of Savo Island. That should be the flag right? It did say a geographic feature...

No, calm down. It said one word. Looking at the [Wikipedia page for the battle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Savo_Island), it says that the battle was near the island of Guadalcanal. Guadalcanal is one word.

The flag is `Guadalcanal`
